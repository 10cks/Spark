## **Development**

### note

There are three components in this project, so you have to build them all.

Go to [Quick start](#quick-start) if you don't want to make yourself boring.

* Client
* Server
* Front-end

If you want to make client support OS except linux and windows, you should install some additional C compiler.

For example, to support android, you have to install [Android NDK](https://developer.android.com/ndk/downloads).

### tutorial

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/XZB-1248/Spark


$ cd ./Spark-master


# Here we're going to build front-end pages.
$ cd ./web
# Install all dependencies and build.
$ npm install
$ npm run build-prod


# Embed all static resouces into one single file by using statik.
$ cd ..
$ go install github.com/rakyll/statik
$ statik -m -src="./web/dist" -f -dest="./server/embed" -p web -ns web


# Now we should build client.
$ mkdir ./built
# Use this when you're using windows.
$ ./build.client.bat

# When you're using unix-like OS, you can use this.
$ ./build.client.sh


# Finally we're compiling the server side.
$ go build -ldflags "-s -w" -o Spark Spark/Server
